# Guitar note game

A simple game that prompts the user to play a certain note on the guitar. They have a limited amount of time to play this note before they lose.

# Why?

I've been trying to memorize the fretboard so I can learn music theory and freestyling. I thought this would be a fun way to quickly put my learning to the test so that I knowing where the notes are on the fretboard becomes second nature. I also wanted to use this oppurtinity to practice building a pretty minimilist UI.

# Note:
You will need python <= 3.12. 3.13 has removed one of the necessary requirements for recording audio using the `Sound device` library.
